I wrestled a bear once.  It wasn't very big.  To be honest, it was actually a teddy bear.

Jacob Brevard: Funny you mention that. I once was attacked by a grizzly because I 
followed her down a trail. This was not smart on my behalf.

Ruizhe Wang: I have never seen a wild animals. But once I was stinged by a bee even I just walk by.

Jacob Brevard: That must have hurt. I love being outdoors. Any chanch I get to be outside I will take it. I love hiking, biking, fishing, etc. This one time I caught a 40 mound salmon that almost pulled me into the water. I would like to catch a shark someday.

Charlie Stock: I am also a huge outdoors guy! I actually have caught a few sharks with my buddy who has a vacation home in florida. I caught a small little hammerhead shark and a 5 foot blacktip! Let me tell you they fight like no other fish I have ever caught... I Wish I was a better fisher however. Maybe one day I will be like the guy on river monsters. One can dream.
